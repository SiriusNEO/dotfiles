Plugins:
- [AutoComplPop](https://github.com/vim-scripts/AutoComplPop)
- [ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale)

Since config Vim is annoying, I prepare a zip file for one-click importing.

- Download (wget / curl) and unzip it. Then move all files (`.vim`, `.vimrc`, `.viminfo`) into your $HOME.

### Misc
- `taglist` plugin relies on `ctags` which should be installed in the command line. Be sure that your `ctags` is in the right version (Although I don't include this plugin in my list because of mysterious bugs).
